# emomemo
emotion training game combined with the classic memory game
I have also created a web version of this game in the classic folder
just open the index.html file in the /html/ folder 
click on the blackboard to begin the game

## future

potentially a face recognition feature with a camera

## Setup
Print out two sets of game cards on a thicker paper .
Cut them out with scissors, taking care of safety 
Glue the cards to cardboard cards

## How to play?

Pick two cards 
Remember the emotions and where they were
if they form a pair score them for yourself and pick another two
repeat if you find another match

## Players
One to six players can play the game

## Variants
For a bit of extra fun:
- tell a story of what happened when you last felt the two emotions
- act out the emotion you pick
- combine one of previous player's emotion with one of yours and tell a story why they might be connected, 
+ pick one other player who will then have to guess the emotion you mime with your facial expression
